## Preparation

1. **Choose a Server**

   - Recommended for English speakers: mastodon.social, mstdn.social

2. **Create Account**

   - Click "Sign up" on the chosen server
   - Enter username, email, and password
   - Confirm your email address

3. **Set Up Profile**

4. **Follow People**
   - Search for hashtags that interest you
   - Follow interesting accounts
   - Use the local and federated timelines for discovery

## Dessert

**Apps**: There are many apps for Mastodon - e.g., Tusky (Android), Ivory (iOS), or use the web interface.

**Migration**: You can later move to a different server and take your followers with you.

## Topping

- **Decentralized**: No single company controls the network
