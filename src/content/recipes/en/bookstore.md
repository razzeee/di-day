# Local Bookstore

Support local businesses and social projects when buying books.

## Preparation

1. **Search for Local Bookstores**

   - Use a search engine or map to find bookstores in your area
   - Visit them personally and discover the selection

2. **Discover Online Alternatives**

   - Look for bookstores that donate profits or support local shops
   - Examples: bookshop.org (supports local bookstores)

3. **Second-Hand Alternatives**
   - Buy used books to save resources
   - Local second-hand stores or online marketplaces for used books

## Dessert

**Library**: Use your local library - many also offer e-book lending.

**Book Clubs**: Exchange books with friends or join a book club.

## Topping

- **Local Economy**: Supports local jobs
- **Advice**: Personal book recommendations from expert staff
- **Sustainability**: Shorter delivery routes, less packaging
- **Fair Working Conditions**: Better conditions than at large online retailers
