# Partners

## A broad alliance of organizations from all corners of society has launched DI.DAY.

But that was just the beginning: DI.DAY is for everyone. The circle of initiators is now closed, but we welcome other organizations, associations, and initiatives to participate in DI.DAY with their own ideas, events (feel free to register at [termine.di.day](https://termine.di.day)), and information offerings.
