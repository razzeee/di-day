# Why Digital Independence?

## The Challenge

Large technology corporations now control significant parts of our digital lives. They collect massive amounts of data about us, influence our perception through algorithms, and wield enormous power over our daily existence. This concentration of power is problematic – for our privacy, for democracy, and for a free internet.

## The Solution Already Exists

The good news: there are privacy-friendly and ethical alternatives for almost every digital service. From search engines to email to messaging apps – switching is often easier than you think. And the more people who take this step, the stronger the movement becomes.

## Why a Whole Day for This?

The **Digital Independence Day** is more than just an action day. It's a symbol of the need for change and an opportunity for each of us to take a step forward. On the **first Sunday of every month**, we invite you to:

- **Switch a service** – try an alternative
- **Share your experiences** – inspire others
- **Be part of a movement** – together we are stronger

## Small Steps, Big Impact

You don't have to change everything at once. Every small step counts. Switch one service per month, share your experiences with friends and family. In this way, a movement builds that creates pressure and makes alternatives visible.
