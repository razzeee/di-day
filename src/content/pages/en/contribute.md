# Contribute

Digital independence is best achieved together. There are many ways you can be part of the movement!

## Join Our Community

Join our [Digital Independence Space on the Matrix network](https://matrix.to/#/#di-space:fairydust.space). Here you can connect with others, ask questions, and make the switch to privacy-friendly alternatives together.

## Use Practical Guides

Check out our [recipes](/en/recipes) for practical, step-by-step guides to various alternatives.

## Tell Others About Your Switch

Your switch to digital independence is just the first step – tell others about it! This is one of the most important ways you can contribute.

We provide social media templates that you can use to share your experience. Simply download them and post with the hashtags **#DIDit** or **#DUTgemacht**.

You can also use a [post generator](https://qznc.github.io/dot/diday.html) to create your own DID posts.

## Celebrate Digital Independence Day With Us

Join us and post on your channels to show you're part of this movement! Your voice and your story matter to others who want to take the same path.
